# GeronGnosis
This dataset contains the EEG resting state-closed eyes recordings from 50 subjects in total, modeled as explicit features, in a compressed Weka ARFF file.

Participants: 15 of them were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD group), 5 were diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD group),
10 were diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 20 were healthy subjects (CN group). 
Cognition was evaluated by the international Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

The groups are labeled in the following sequence:
0 - MCI
1 - AD
2 - FTD
3 - Healthy Control

The MMSE scores and age of the participants are included in the article titled "GeronGnosis: A Database for Diagnosing Dementias Using EEG and Machine Learning," submitted to the journal Research on Biomedical Engineering.
